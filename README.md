Benefits of this solution:

Steps to run:
  - clone repository
  - change connection string at appsetting.json in project API (API layer)
  - this solution use sql server and default db management. If you use mysql or other db, change OnConfiguring in 
DAL/Contexts/DatabaseContext.cs. Read more at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/configuring-dbcontext#configuring-dbcontextoptions
  - at package manager console, switch target project to DAL (DAL layer)
  - type : 
    + add-migration Initial 
    + update-database
  - after that, check your db if it created new db successfully

Steps to add new model API:
  - at DAL layer: add new model to Models folder
  - at BLL layer: add new I[Model]Service and [Model]Service to Services folder
  - at API layer: add new controller to Controllers foler
